\begin{abstract}
    % \textbf{Context} 
    The Local Group mass sets the distribution and kinematics of its constituent galaxies and is necessary to place it in a cosmological context. Though challenging to measure, one method that has been used to estimate the Local Group mass is the Timing Argument, which constructs a Keplerian orbital model that is matched to the observed kinematics of M31 with respect to the Milky Way. 
    However, recent observations of stellar tracers in the outer MW halo have revealed an excess velocity dipole in the radial velocities that can be interpretted as a bulk motion of the Milky Way disk with respect to its outer halo. 
    This motion of the disk has previously been unaccounted for in Timing Argument models. 
    % \textbf{Aims} 
    We aim to infer a Local Group mass that accounts for the reflex motion of the Milky Way disk.    
    % \textbf{Methods} 
    We use Bayesian techniques to fit collected datasets of 6D phase-space information of M31 and determine the dependence of the inferred Local Group mass on the magnitude of the reflex motion.
    % \textbf{Results} 
    We provide an updated Local Group mass of $4.69\pm0.71 \times 10^{12}$M$_\odot$ assuming a disk travel velocity of $32\rm km/s$. 
    Additionally, we find that the inclusion of the reflex motion of the MW disk systematically lowers the inferred Local Group mass via the Timing Argument, and that the recovered mass depends strongly on the assumed travel velocity of the disk.
    Further measurements of the reflex motion of the disk will likely yield a larger observed travel velocity, and therefore a lower Local Group mass. In addition, improvements to proper motion measurements from future Gaia data releases may improve the constraint on the Local Group mass by a factor of $\sim2$.
    % \textbf{Conclusions}
    The Timing Argument remains one of the only ways to measure the Local Group mass independently of the masses of the individual component galaxies, but it is clear that the effect of the LMC must be accounted for when using these techniques.

\begin{itemize}
    \item importance of knowing mass of the local group

            \item 
          \end{itemize}
    \item ways to measure local group mass
    \item \begin{itemize}
            \item other tracers? 
            \item introduction of timing argument 
            \item what previous TA measurements of the local group mass have been
          \end{itemize}
    \item what's wrong with previous use of TA?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the LMC is massive and pulling on the MW disk
            \item previous use of timing argument did not account for travel velocity of the disk
            \item we include the travel velocity of the disk
        \end{itemize}
    \item cosmological impact
        \begin{itemize}
            \item bias and calibration of the timing argument 
            \item what a lower/higher group mass means (we're gonna be more consistent w other group mass measurements, I think?)
        \end{itemize}
